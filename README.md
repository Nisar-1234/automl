# PROJECT GOAL

 This project is designed to **Create Automated-ML-Application-for-Exploratory-Data-Analysis-Streamlit-Deployment with Python, streamlit, HTML** 
 <br>
 A highly comprehensive analysis with all **data cleaning, exploration, visualization have been in back end with python** and its **intention to create it like a NO CODE PLATFORM**

# Project Motivation

**I have been practicing Machine Learning for Past 6 Months, For implementing Regression, Classification and NLP models EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS is must to understand the data. But it will take more time to Write code and to finish EDA, Its TIME CONSUMING, so it motivated me to create a NO CODE WEB APP for EDA**

# Requirements Installation

**The Code is written in Python 3.7. If you don't have Python installed you can find it here. If you are using a lower version of Python you can upgrade using the pip package, ensuring you have the latest version of pip. To install the required packages and libraries, run this command in the project directory after cloning the repository**

    pip install -r requirements.txt
    
# File Section

### App.py

**It consists of User Defing Functions To automate The Application**
<br>

**All EDA Analysis have been implemented in back end**
